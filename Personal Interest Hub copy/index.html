        <h2>The Origin of Jollof Rice</h2>
        <p>
            Jollof Rice originated from the ancient Wolof (or Jolof) Empire located in what is now
            <strong>Senegal and The Gambia</strong>. As traders and cultures mixed across West Africa,
            the recipe spread and evolved into many beloved variations.
        </p>

        <p>
            Today, Jollof is more than just a meal. It is a cultural symbol of pride, celebration,
            and even a friendly rivalry known as the <strong>"Jollof Wars"</strong> between countries
            like Nigeria and Ghana.
